## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Free streaming URLs (SomaFM etc.) chosen for audio — no visible player needed, multiple categories, free
- Minimal + expandable UI pattern (keeps timer screen clean)
- Pause on break by default (breaks feel distinct from focus)
- Separate volume controls (timer alerts audible even with loud music)
- YouTube embeds rejected — visible 200x200px player requirement is intrusive

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None yet.
