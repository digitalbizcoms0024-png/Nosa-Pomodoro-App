## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- YouTube embeds chosen for audio (free, huge library, no hosting costs)
- Minimal + expandable UI pattern (keeps timer screen clean)
- Pause on break by default (breaks feel distinct from focus)
- Separate volume controls (timer alerts audible even with loud music)
