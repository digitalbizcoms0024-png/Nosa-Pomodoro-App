## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| YouTube embeds | Visible 200x200px player requirement is intrusive |
| Audio mixing/layering | High complexity, defer to future |
| User-uploaded audio | Moderation and legal concerns |
| Spotify/Apple Music integration | Requires OAuth, premium accounts, API costs |
| Audio visualizer | Not core to productivity value |
| Offline audio playback | Conflicts with streaming approach |
| Complex equalizer | Overwhelming for a focus app |
