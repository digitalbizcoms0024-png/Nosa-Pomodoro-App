    <h1>17 Proven Techniques to Boost Productivity with ADHD</h1>

    <p>A 2023 study in the <em>Journal of Attention Disorders</em> found that adults with ADHD spend an average of 2.5 hours per workday on unintentional task-switching. That is 12.5 hours a week &mdash; more than an entire workday &mdash; lost to a brain that keeps pulling you away from the thing you sat down to do.</p>

    <p>I am not going to tell you to "just focus harder." That advice is useless if you have ADHD. What I will give you are 17 specific techniques to <strong>boost productivity with ADHD</strong> &mdash; each one designed to work with your neurology rather than pretend it does not exist. Some of these you have probably heard before. Others might surprise you. Not all 17 will work for you, and that is the point. ADHD brains habituate fast. You need a rotation, not a single silver bullet.</p>

    <div class="key-takeaways">
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>ADHD productivity is about <strong>external structure</strong>, not internal willpower</li>
        <li>The best system is a <strong>rotating toolkit</strong> of techniques, not one rigid method</li>
        <li>Visual timers, body doubling, and environment design give the highest return on effort</li>
        <li>Every technique here targets a specific ADHD barrier: <a href="/blog/time-blindness-adhd/">time blindness</a>, dopamine dysregulation, or executive dysfunction</li>
        <li>Start with 2-3 techniques, not all 17</li>

    <h2 id="visual-timers">1. Visual Timers</h2>

    <p>Most timers are just numbers counting down. For an ADHD brain with <a href="/blog/time-blindness-adhd/">time blindness</a>, those numbers might as well be written in a foreign language. You glance at "18:42" and your brain does not register that less than half the time remains. The number is abstract. It does not feel like anything.</p>

    <p>Visual timers solve this by turning time into something spatial. A shrinking red disk. A progress ring filling clockwise. A bar draining from left to right. Your brain can read these instantly without translating numbers into meaning. You see how much is gone and how much is left the same way you see a glass half full of water &mdash; immediately and without effort.</p>

    <p>The research backs this up. A <a href="https://chadd.org/about/about-adhd/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CHADD</a>-cited review of ADHD interventions found that visual time aids significantly improved on-task behavior in both children and adults with ADHD. Physical Time Timer clocks have been a staple of occupational therapy for years. Digital versions like <a href="https://pomodorotimer.vip">Pomodoro Timer</a> bring the same concept to your browser with an animated progress ring and zero setup friction.</p>

    <p>If you try only one technique from this list, make it this one. Time awareness is the foundation everything else builds on.</p>

    <h2 id="body-doubling">2. Body Doubling</h2>

    <p>Body doubling means working in the presence of another person. That is it. They do not need to help you. They do not need to check on you. They just need to be there, doing their own thing, while you do yours.</p>

    <p>It sounds too simple to work. It works anyway.</p>

    <p>The theory is that the presence of another person activates mild social accountability and provides ambient stimulation that keeps the ADHD brain engaged. Think of it as the reason you could study in a busy library but not in your empty apartment. The background social energy gives your brain just enough input to stay anchored to the task.</p>

    <p>Options for body doubling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In person:</strong> Work alongside a friend, partner, or coworker. Coffee shops work too &mdash; strangers count.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual:</strong> Focusmate pairs you with a stranger for 25 or 50-minute video work sessions. You state your goal, work silently, and report at the end. It is free for three sessions per week.</li>
      <li><strong>Async:</strong> Discord servers and Slack communities dedicated to coworking. ADHD Twitter/X has running "body doubling" threads.</li>
      <li><strong>Streaming:</strong> Some people stream themselves working on Twitch or YouTube. The possibility that someone might be watching provides the same accountability effect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I think body doubling is underrated in the productivity space because it does not fit the narrative of the solo high-performer grinding alone at 5 AM. But for ADHD brains, social scaffolding is not a crutch. It is a tool.</p>

    <h2 id="task-decomposition">3. Task Decomposition</h2>

    <p>"Write the report" is not a task. It is a project wearing a task's clothing. Your ADHD brain looks at it and sees a wall of ambiguity &mdash; unclear steps, unknown duration, multiple decisions to make before you can even begin. So it does what any sensible brain would do when facing an undefined threat: it avoids.</p>

    <p>Task decomposition means breaking that wall into bricks. Each brick is a single, physical action that takes five minutes or less:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Open Google Docs and create a blank document</li>
      <li>Type the report title and three section headings</li>
      <li>Find two statistics from last quarter's data</li>
      <li>Write three sentences for the first section</li>
      <li>Draft the summary paragraph</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Notice how each step is concrete. You can picture yourself doing it. There is no ambiguity about what "done" looks like. That clarity is what lets your executive function system engage &mdash; it can handle "type three headings" even when it cannot handle "write the report."</p>

    <p>The rule of thumb: if a task makes you feel overwhelmed when you read it, it is not small enough yet. <a href="/blog/stop-procrastinating-adhd/">Break it down further</a> until starting feels almost trivially easy.</p>

    <h2 id="two-minute-rule">4. The Two-Minute Rule</h2>

    <p>David Allen coined this in <em>Getting Things Done</em>: if a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately instead of writing it down. For ADHD, this rule is gold &mdash; but not for the reason Allen intended.</p>

    <p>The original logic is about efficiency. The ADHD logic is about momentum. Every tiny task you complete generates a small dopamine hit. Reply to that email. Put that dish in the dishwasher. Send that text. File that document. Each two-minute completion gives your brain evidence that you are a person who gets things done, which makes the next task easier to start.</p>

    <p>The danger: ADHD brains can turn the two-minute rule into a procrastination engine, doing twenty small tasks to avoid one big one. Guard against this by setting a limit. Do two-minute tasks for the first ten minutes of your work session as a warm-up, then transition to your main task. Use them to build momentum, not to replace the work that matters.</p>

    <h2 id="time-blocking">5. Time Blocking (Modified)</h2>

    <p>Standard time blocking &mdash; the kind Cal Newport describes &mdash; assigns every minute of your day to a specific activity. For ADHD, this is a recipe for failure. One disruption, one unexpected task, one phone call that runs long, and the entire schedule collapses. Then comes the shame spiral of "I can never stick to a plan."</p>

    <p>Modified time blocking works differently. Instead of scheduling tasks to specific times, you block your day into three types of zones:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Zone Type</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
          <th>Example</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Deep Work</strong></td>
          <td>High-focus tasks requiring sustained attention</td>
          <td>9 AM &ndash; 11 AM: Project work</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Shallow Work</strong></td>
          <td>Emails, admin, low-stakes tasks</td>
          <td>11 AM &ndash; 12 PM: Inbox and messages</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Buffer</strong></td>
          <td>Catch-up time, overflow, or rest</td>
          <td>2 PM &ndash; 2:30 PM: Open</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The buffer zones are what make this ADHD-compatible. They absorb the inevitable disruptions without breaking the whole schedule. You do not assign specific tasks to exact times &mdash; you just protect your deep work windows and give yourself permission to be flexible within the zones. When a deep work block goes poorly, the buffer is there to catch you.</p>

    <h2 id="dopamine-menu">6. The Dopamine Menu</h2>

    <p>This one comes from the ADHD community, and I think it is brilliant. A dopamine menu is a pre-made list of activities organized by the amount of effort and stimulation they provide. You create it during a clear-headed moment and reference it when your brain is screaming for stimulation during a break or after a work session.</p>

    <p>The categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appetizers</strong> (5 min, low effort): Stretch, look out the window, pet your dog, eat a piece of fruit, doodle</li>
      <li><strong>Main courses</strong> (15-30 min, moderate effort): Go for a walk, play guitar, sketch, read a chapter, do a puzzle</li>
      <li><strong>Desserts</strong> (high stimulation, use sparingly): Video games, social media scroll, online shopping, binge-watching</li>
      <li><strong>Specials</strong> (high effort but deeply satisfying): Cook a new recipe, build something, deep-clean a room, exercise hard</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The menu prevents the "I am bored but nothing sounds good" paralysis that hits ADHD brains between tasks. It also prevents defaulting to desserts &mdash; the high-stimulation activities like social media and video games that feel good but leave you more depleted. When the timer goes off at the end of a focus session, you do not have to decide what to do. You just pick from the menu.</p>

    <h2 id="movement-breaks">7. Movement Breaks</h2>

    <p>Sitting still is an executive function task. If that surprises you, consider that maintaining physical stillness requires your prefrontal cortex to continuously inhibit the impulse to move. For an ADHD brain already taxing its prefrontal cortex to stay focused on work, the added demand of sitting still is like running a second program on a computer that is already struggling.</p>

    <p>Movement breaks are not optional extras. They are performance resets. A 2022 meta-analysis in <em>Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews</em> found that acute physical activity improved attention and executive function in adults with ADHD for up to 90 minutes after exercise.</p>

    <p>What works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>10 jumping jacks between Pomodoro sessions</li>
      <li>A 5-minute walk around the block</li>
      <li>Push-ups, squats, or planks &mdash; anything that raises your heart rate briefly</li>
      <li>Dancing to one song (seriously &mdash; it works)</li>
      <li>Standing desk with a balance board for movement during work, not just between tasks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The mistake is treating breaks as mental rest only. Your ADHD brain does not need to sit quietly and recharge like a phone. It needs to move, discharge restless energy, and return to the task with a refreshed neurochemical state.</p>

    </div>

    <h2 id="environment-design">8. Environment Design</h2>

    <p>Your environment is either working for you or against you. There is no neutral. Every object in your visual field, every notification on your phone, every open browser tab is a potential off-ramp for your attention. ADHD brains do not filter these inputs well &mdash; the prefrontal cortex that should be saying "ignore that, stay on task" is already working overtime.</p>

    <p>Effective environment design for ADHD:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Single-purpose spaces.</strong> If possible, work in a place you only use for work. Your brain associates environments with behaviors. Working in bed teaches your brain that bed means work, which ruins sleep. Working at a dedicated desk teaches your brain that this desk means focus.</li>
      <li><strong>Phone in another room.</strong> Not face-down on the desk. Not in a drawer. In another room. The physical effort required to retrieve it creates enough friction to interrupt most impulses. A 2017 study from the University of Texas found that even having a phone visible on the desk reduced cognitive capacity, even when the phone was off.</li>
      <li><strong>Website blockers with teeth.</strong> Cold Turkey and Freedom let you block distracting sites on a schedule. The key feature: they should be hard to disable once active. ADHD impulsivity will bypass any blocker with an easy off-switch.</li>
      <li><strong>Noise management.</strong> Some ADHD brains need silence. Most need something &mdash; brown noise, lo-fi beats, ambient coffee shop sounds. Experiment to find what works, then use it consistently as a focus cue.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual minimalism.</strong> Clear the desk of everything not related to the current task. Close every browser tab you are not using right now. A clean visual field means fewer things competing for your attention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="external-accountability">9. External Accountability</h2>

    <p>ADHD brains have weak internal accountability systems. The voice that says "you said you would do this today" gets drowned out by the voice that says "but this other thing is more interesting right now." External accountability puts another human in the loop, which activates the social motivation circuits that are often stronger than self-directed motivation in ADHD.</p>

    <p>Forms of external accountability, ranked by effectiveness:</p>

    </ol>

    <p>The common objection: "I don't want to depend on other people to get things done." I understand the sentiment. But consider this: neurotypical people have internal systems that provide accountability automatically. You do not. Using external accountability is not weakness &mdash; it is compensation for a neurological difference, the same way glasses compensate for poor eyesight.</p>

    <h2 id="task-batching">10. Task Batching</h2>

    <p>Context switching has a cost. For neurotypical brains, that cost is about 15-25 minutes of reduced performance after each switch. For ADHD brains, the cost is higher because re-engaging with a task requires task initiation &mdash; the executive function that is already impaired.</p>

    <p>Task batching groups similar tasks together so you only need to "get into the zone" once. All emails in one 30-minute block. All phone calls back-to-back. All writing in one session. All admin tasks lumped together on Friday afternoon.</p>

    <p>The result: fewer transitions, fewer initiation demands, and more time spent in productive flow rather than restarting. Pair task batching with <a href="/blog/best-pomodoro-intervals/">timed Pomodoro intervals</a> and you get structured sessions with clear start and end points, which is exactly the kind of external structure ADHD thrives on.</p>

    <h2 id="implementation-intentions">11. Implementation Intentions</h2>

    <p>"I will work on the project after lunch" is a plan. "When I close my laptop after eating lunch, I will open the project document and write for 15 minutes" is an implementation intention. The difference matters.</p>

    <p>Implementation intentions use an if-then format that links a specific cue to a specific action. Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer's research shows they dramatically increase follow-through, and the effect is even stronger for people with executive function difficulties. The if-then structure bypasses the need for deliberate decision-making at the moment of action &mdash; you have already decided, so your brain just executes.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"When I sit down at my desk with coffee, I will open my task list and start the first item."</li>
      <li>"When the Pomodoro break timer goes off, I will do 10 jumping jacks before sitting back down."</li>
      <li>"When I feel the urge to check my phone, I will take three deep breaths and refocus on the task."</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Write these down. Put them on a sticky note next to your screen. The physical reminder compensates for working memory limitations that might cause you to forget the intention entirely.</p>

    <h2 id="the-pomodoro-method">12. The Pomodoro Method (ADHD-Modified)</h2>

    <p>The standard Pomodoro Technique &mdash; 25 minutes of work, 5-minute break, repeat four times, then take a long break &mdash; was not designed for ADHD. It is rigid, it assumes consistent focus capacity, and the 25-minute interval is arbitrary. That said, the core idea of working in timed bursts with structured breaks is one of the most effective <a href="/blog/adhd-focus-techniques/">focus techniques for ADHD</a>.</p>

    <p>The ADHD modifications that matter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Flexible intervals.</strong> Start with 15 minutes if 25 feels impossible. Go to 35 or 40 on days when focus comes easily. There is no correct number &mdash; just the number that works today.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual countdown.</strong> Use a timer that shows time as a visual shape, not just digits. A <a href="https://pomodorotimer.vip">progress ring</a> or draining bar gives your time-blind brain the spatial awareness it needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Planned break activities.</strong> Decide what you will do during the break before the session starts. Without a plan, breaks expand indefinitely because the ADHD brain struggles to self-interrupt enjoyable activities and return to work.</li>
      <li><strong>No shame restarts.</strong> If you break focus during a session, do not scrap it. Reset the timer and start a fresh session. Completion is not the goal &mdash; engagement is.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the full breakdown, see our guide on <a href="/blog/pomodoro-technique-adhd/">the Pomodoro Technique for ADHD</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="working-memory-offloading">13. Working Memory Offloading</h2>

    <p>Working memory in ADHD is like a desk that is too small. You can put three things on it, and the moment you add a fourth, something falls off the edge. Tasks, deadlines, appointments, ideas, grocery items &mdash; they all compete for the same limited space. When your working memory is full, executive function drops even further because your brain is spending its resources on remembering rather than doing.</p>

    <p>The fix: get everything out of your head and into an external system. Immediately. Every time.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Capture tools.</strong> A pocket notebook, a voice memo app, a single running note on your phone. The specific tool does not matter &mdash; what matters is that you always have it and always use it.</li>
      <li><strong>One trusted inbox.</strong> Do not split your tasks across five apps. Pick one place where everything goes and review it daily. Todoist, Apple Reminders, a physical notebook &mdash; anything simple enough that you will actually use it.</li>
      <li><strong>Visible reminders.</strong> Sticky notes on your monitor. Whiteboard on the wall. Things you need to do should be visible from where you sit, not buried in an app you have to open.</li>
      <li><strong>Calendar everything.</strong> Not just meetings. Dentist appointments, bill due dates, "call mom," picking up dry cleaning. If it has a time component, it goes on the calendar with a notification.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Think of this as freeing up RAM. The less your brain has to hold, the more it can process.</p>

    <h2 id="transition-rituals">14. Transition Rituals</h2>

    <p>Switching between tasks or contexts is one of the hardest things for an ADHD brain. You finish one thing (or get pulled away from it) and the residue of that activity lingers in your mind while you try to engage with the next one. Or you finish a break and cannot figure out how to re-engage with work. The transition itself becomes a gap where procrastination enters.</p>

    <p>Transition rituals are short, consistent routines that signal to your brain: "we are switching modes now." They serve as a bridge between activities.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before starting work: make a specific drink, put on headphones, open the timer, review your task list. Same order every time.</li>
      <li>Between tasks: stand up, stretch, write one sentence about what you just finished and one sentence about what you are starting.</li>
      <li>After work: close all tabs, write tomorrow's top three priorities, shut the laptop. The physical act of closing the laptop becomes the end-of-work signal.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The consistency is what makes these work. Over time, your brain associates the ritual with the transition, and the switch becomes semi-automatic rather than requiring a fresh act of willpower each time.</p>

    <h2 id="energy-mapping">15. Energy Mapping</h2>

    <p>Not all hours are created equal. ADHD brains have pronounced energy peaks and valleys throughout the day, and these patterns are often different from neurotypical ones. Many people with ADHD report a late-morning focus peak, a severe post-lunch dip, and a surprising burst of energy in the late evening.</p>

    <p>Energy mapping means tracking your focus and energy levels for one to two weeks and then scheduling tasks to match your natural rhythms:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"I stopped trying to do deep work at 9 AM because every productivity book told me to. I tracked my energy for two weeks and discovered my brain doesn't come online until 10:30. Now I do admin and emails from 9 to 10:30 and deep work from 10:30 to 12:30. My output tripled."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Put your hardest, most attention-demanding tasks in your peak windows. Put routine, low-stakes tasks in your valleys. Stop fighting your biology and start using it. This alone can dramatically <strong>boost productivity with ADHD</strong> without adding any new tools or systems.</p>

    <h2 id="artificial-deadlines">16. Artificial Deadlines</h2>

    <p>ADHD brains run on urgency. A deadline three weeks away generates zero motivation. The same deadline three hours away generates laser focus, racing heartbeat, and a burst of hyperfocused output. This is the interest-based nervous system at work &mdash; urgency is one of the four triggers that activate ADHD engagement.</p>

    <p>The problem with relying on real deadlines: chronic last-minute panic, lower quality work, and accumulated stress. The solution is manufacturing urgency without the consequences.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tell someone you will deliver by a specific time.</strong> "I will send you the draft by 2 PM." Now the deadline is social, which makes it real to your brain.</li>
      <li><strong>Schedule a meeting to present your progress.</strong> Even if it is informal. The meeting creates an immovable deadline that your brain cannot rationalize away.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Beeminder or StickK.</strong> These apps let you pledge money that you forfeit if you miss your goal. Financial stakes create urgency fast.</li>
      <li><strong>Race the timer.</strong> "Can I finish this section before the <a href="/blog/pomodoro-technique-guide/">Pomodoro timer</a> runs out?" Turning work into a race against the clock triggers both urgency and the competitive drive that many ADHD brains respond to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="reward-pairing">17. Reward Pairing</h2>

    <p>This is the last technique because it amplifies every other technique on this list. ADHD brains are dopamine-seeking machines. If a task does not generate dopamine, your brain will find something that does &mdash; and that something is usually not the task you need to do.</p>

    <p>Reward pairing means deliberately linking a dopamine source to the task you are avoiding:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Only listen to a favorite podcast while doing chores.</strong> The podcast becomes the reward, and the chore becomes the vehicle for accessing it.</li>
      <li><strong>Only drink your fancy coffee during deep work sessions.</strong> The coffee ritual becomes associated with focus.</li>
      <li><strong>After every completed Pomodoro session, give yourself a specific micro-reward.</strong> A piece of chocolate, two minutes of a favorite video, a stretch. The reward must be immediate, not at the end of the day. Delayed rewards do not register for dopamine-depleted brains.</li>
      <li><strong>Track your completed sessions visually.</strong> Watching a number go up or a streak extend is itself a dopamine source. <a href="https://pomodorotimer.vip">Pomodoro Timer</a> tracks your daily session count and shows your progress toward a daily goal &mdash; that visible proof of forward motion keeps the momentum going.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The key insight: you are not bribing yourself. You are compensating for a neurochemical deficit. Neurotypical brains generate enough dopamine from task completion alone to sustain motivation. Yours might not. Pairing external rewards with productive tasks is not a weakness &mdash; it is an adaptation.</p>

    <h2>Building Your Personal Toolkit</h2>

    <p>Do not try to implement all 17 techniques at once. That is a fast track to overwhelm and abandonment. Here is how to build your system:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Pick your foundation.</strong> Choose one technique from each category: a time management tool (visual timer, time blocking, or Pomodoro), a task management approach (decomposition, batching, or working memory offloading), and one motivation strategy (body doubling, accountability, or reward pairing).</li>
      <li><strong>Run it for two weeks.</strong> Give each technique a genuine trial. Track what works and what does not in a simple log.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotate when something stops working.</strong> ADHD brains habituate. A technique that works brilliantly in week one may lose its effect by week four. This is not failure &mdash; it is your neurology. Swap in a new technique from the same category and keep the ones that are still working.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep a "what works" list.</strong> Write down every technique that has ever worked for you, even briefly. When you are stuck, refer to the list instead of trying to reinvent your system from scratch.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The goal is not perfection. It is having enough tools in your rotation that you always have something that works right now, even if it is different from what worked last month.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-section">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is the best productivity system for someone with ADHD?</h3>
        <p>There is no single best system. The most effective approach combines several techniques: visual timers for time awareness, task decomposition for reducing overwhelm, body doubling for accountability, and environment design for minimizing distractions. Build a rotating toolkit of 3-5 techniques rather than committing to one rigid method. What works changes over time as your brain habituates, and that is normal.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do traditional productivity tips fail for ADHD?</h3>
        <p>Traditional advice assumes a functioning executive function system. Tips like "just start" or "prioritize your tasks" require task initiation, working memory, and time perception &mdash; exactly the cognitive functions ADHD impairs. Effective ADHD productivity techniques externalize these functions through tools, environmental changes, and social structures instead of relying on willpower. That is why techniques like body doubling and visual timers work where "try harder" does not.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I stay productive with ADHD without medication?</h3>
        <p>Non-medication strategies include body doubling, visual timers, the two-minute rule, dopamine menus, environment design, task decomposition, and movement breaks. Many people with ADHD use these techniques effectively on their own. The most important factor is building external structure that compensates for impaired internal executive function. That said, medication and behavioral strategies are not mutually exclusive &mdash; they often work best together, and a conversation with a psychiatrist is worth having.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long should ADHD focus sessions be?</h3>
        <p>It varies by person and task. Many people with ADHD find that 15-25 minute sessions work best, though some prefer 10-minute sprints on difficult days or 45-minute blocks during <a href="/blog/adhd-hyperfocus/">hyperfocus</a>. Start with 15 minutes and adjust based on your experience. The standard 25-minute Pomodoro interval is a starting point, not a rule. Use a tool with <a href="/blog/best-pomodoro-intervals/">flexible interval settings</a> so you can adjust without friction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can ADHD people be highly productive?</h3>
        <p>Yes. ADHD brains are capable of extraordinary output, especially when tasks align with the interest-based nervous system. The challenge is not ability but consistency &mdash; accessing that output reliably rather than only during deadline panic or hyperfocus episodes. The right combination of external structure, environmental support, and self-knowledge can make high productivity sustainable rather than sporadic.</p>
